Welcome to my hands-on lab where I'm building real-world IT support, networking, and system admin skills.

This repo includes:
- 🧪 VirtualBox lab setups (Ubuntu & Windows 10)
- 🔧 Break & fix scenarios (and how I recovered)
- 🌐 Networking tests (ping, SSH, Host-only adapters)
- 🧠 Weekly “What I Learned” posts

⚠️ I’m a beginner building my skills in IT Support, networking, and system administration. This repo is my hands-on learning journal as I complete the Google IT Support Certificate and prepare for CompTIA A+.
